- question: How do I check if my business name idea is available?
  answer: >-
    <p>A quick web search will reveal if the company name you like has domain availability. Even if there’s an existing brand with a similar name, depending on its industry, location, and reach, you may be able to secure an alternative domain that’s available using other domain extensions (e.g., .co or .us instead of .com). </p>
    <p>To be extra careful, you can search the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). If another company has already registered the name you like, they may have the exclusive right to that business name. Visit the USPTO website for a <a href="https://www.uspto.gov/trademarks">comprehensive guide</a> to trademark availability and registration.</p>
