  title: FAQ
  qa_list:
    - question: What will team members have access to?
      answer: A lot of that is up to you. You control the permissions for your team and what they can do in B12. You’ll be able to select whether team members can make website updates or account and billing updates, and whether they have access to client engagement tools – like scheduling, client intake, communications, and more.
    - question: Do all team members get the same permissions? 
      answer: Nope! Permissions and feature access are on a per-person basis. So you can pick and choose what each team member can do in B12 based on their role and what you need as a business owner.
    - question: Can I change what team members have access to?
      answer: Absolutely! You can go into your B12 account at any time and adjust permission levels, add, or even remove team members if needed.
    - question: Is there a maximum to how many team members I can add?
      answer: Each plan comes with team member access. On the Essential Plan, you automatically get access for two additional users (plus yourself) for a total of three seats. In the Advanced Plan you get access for four additional users (plus yourself) for a total of five seats. <br>You can also add seats for $39/month/seat, and there’s no limit to how many seats can be added.
    - question: How do I invite a team member from within my B12 account?
      answer: Adding a team member is easy. You’ll find complete details on how to do it in this handy <a href="https://support.b12.io/en/articles/5915192-add-team-members" target="_blank">Help Center article</a>.
    - question: Will team members just be able to collaborate on projects and updates in B12, or have the ability to work in B12 independently? 
      answer: That really depends on the permissions you give them, but the idea behind adding your team is to give them independent access to tools so they can manage their individual books of business – not just be a collaborator. That means team members will be able to better manage their own time, client relationships, and communications – but because it’s all within the same B12 account, you’ll get centralized oversight.
