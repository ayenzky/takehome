- question: Compared with a custom web design agency, what is it like to build a website through the B12 platform?
  answer: >-
    <p>A custom web design agency may eventually (after much back and forth) be able to produce the website of your dreams, but it will likely cost you an arm and a leg. Custom web projects, built from the ground up, typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. The custom design process also requires a lot of communication, normally taking months of meetings to see a finished project. It’s more time-consuming than you initially expect and prone to miscommunications.</p>
    <p>We are proud that launching a website through the B12 platform is entirely different. Our web design process is fast, more affordable, and packed with built-in tools designed specifically for professional service providers, including mortgage brokers, to serve clients online.</p>
    <p>Instead of months, you'll get your first AI-generated draft in seconds. Then, in 30 days or less, you work with a team of designers, writers, and SEO specialists to customize your new website with content, branding, structure, features, and integrations. We offer <a href="https://www.b12.io/pricing/">straightforward pricing</a> so you know what to budget for.</p>
    <p>Throughout the project, we incorporate your feedback to ensure we get it right. Once you sign off on the design, we help you launch ASAP so you can start connecting with your clientele.</p>
- question: What marketing integrations work with B12 websites?
  answer: >-
    <p>B12 has plenty of powerful built-in tools that, depending on your plan, are included in your website and incredibly easy to use. Email marketing, contact management, digital contracts, eSignatures, online scheduling, and payment processing — it’s all baked into your online presence.</p>
    <p>Of course, we also offer all of the popular <a href="https://www.b12.io/integrations.html">third-party integrations</a> you love to use, such as Drift, Medium, Calendly, PayPal, Shopify, and Zillow.</p>
- question: What are SEO best practices for mortgage brokers?
  answer: >-
    <p>Start with the basics: fast page speed, mobile-friendly design, and functional navigation. Then, work with B12's team of SEO and copywriter specialists to build out keyword-driven content that provides helpful information relevant to your niche and market area.</p>
    <p>Finally, grow your backlink portfolio. B12's team helps you start by submitting your website and business to relevant business listings for high-quality backlinks and to drive more traffic from potential clients looking for mortgage solutions.</p>
    <p>You'll also likely want to go local when it comes to mortgage broker SEO. Local SEO aims to grow traffic from searchers in your area through local business listings, geographic keywords, and other tactics.</p>
- question: Should I list my mortgage brokerage on databases specific to the industry? 
  answer: >-
    <p>Yes! The most places you are listed, the more ways clients can find you. If your business is on publicly available lists and databases, it also helps build credibility and trust.</p>
    <p>The most listings you pursue, the more backlinks you'll earn, and the better it is for SEO. B12 will help your website launch by submitting your business to relevant business directories.</p>
    <p>But you can keep earning backlinks by submitting your website to all the professional organizations you belong to, including the National Association of Mortgage Brokers (<a href="https://namb.org/" target="_blank">NAMB</a>), your local Chamber of Commerce, and more. There are also specific databases like <a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/mortgage-brokers" targe="_blank">Rocket</a> <a href="https://www.rocketmortgage.com/mortgage-brokers" target="_blank">Mortgage</a> and <a href="https://www.zillow.com/mortgages/" target="_blank">Zillow</a>. Plus, don't forget about broader databases like <a href="http://yelp.com/" target="_blank">Yelp</a> and <a href="http://finder.com/" target="_blank">FInder.</p>
