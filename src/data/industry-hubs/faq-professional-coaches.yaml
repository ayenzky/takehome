- question: What's the key to a great life coach website design?
  answer: >-
    <p>An effective life coach website design follows some universal best practices but also needs to fit your brand identity and business goals. In general, the most successful professional coaches’ websites have a clean layout, intuitive navigation, cohesive branding, valuable copy, and facilitate seamless client interactions.</p>
    <p>For all professional coaches, including life coaches and business coaches, you want to fill your website with testimonials, online reviews, and case studies, to demonstrate the value you've provided for real people. It's proven — 72% of consumers say <a href="https://boast.io/20-statistics-about-using-testimonials-in-marketing/ "target="_blank">positive testimonials and reviews</a> increase their trust in a business.</p>
    <p>Another make-or-break website element is photography. If you can get professional headshots, it's a great investment in your credibility. Blurry, low-quality, unprofessional photos are a turnoff to website visitors, who'll quickly leave your site and find another provider.</p>
    <p>If you don’t yet have the budget to get new, professional photos taken, look for high-quality free stock images with low usage rates that are relevant to your niche and brand, that at the very least, won’t distract visitors from your site’s content.</p>
- question: How can I get started building my coaching brand?
  answer: >-
    <p>Develop and improve your coaching brand by creating a mission statement. Why did you start your business and what do you aim to help your clients do? What are you selling and why are you selling it? The answers to these questions should all fit into an elevator pitch — or, more relevant nowadays — your website’s homepage hero section copy. The second someone reaches your website, they should be able to read 1-2 lines of copy that explain what you do and why you’re effective.</p>
    <p>Next, build out your brand assets, including logo, brand colors, and website color scheme. It’s worth checking out some free resources on color psychology to choose colors that are authentic to your brand and appeal to prospective clients. For example, orange conjures enthusiasm and excitement, which may be why it's often used by sports teams, but is also associated with some negative emotions like frustration.</p>
    <p>Once you’ve defined your company and created some initial brand assets, you can build a website. Firms just getting up and running may want to use a DIY website builder, but if you already have some team members and clients, you may need a more <a href="https://www.b12.io/">robust online platform</a> that enables you to sell services from your site with relatively minimal effort.</p>
