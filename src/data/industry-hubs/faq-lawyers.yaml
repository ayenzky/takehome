- question: My small firm is losing existing clients to bigger law firms. How can I update my website to be more competitive online?
  answer: >-
    <p>All law firms face fierce competition, and when you're a small law firm, it often feels like you’re at a disadvantage. Luckily, platforms like B12 exist that make it possible and accessible for lawyers to compete against large companies, corporations, and the best law firm websites.</p>
    <p>We design websites that enable smaller law firms and solo attorneys to be more competitive online, even with a limited marketing budget and in a crowded market. If you’re struggling to reach clients or convert website visitors, start by auditing your website. Here are a few questions to ask yourself as you conduct a website audit:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is my website accessible on all devices, including smartphones? More than half of website traffic comes from mobile, so you can’t afford to skip this if you want to gain clients.</li>
      <li>Does each page include a clear next step for visitors? Is there a call-to-action button or link to other key pages, such as the contact page or a relevant blog post?</li>
      <li>Does my site include fresh legal content that prospective clients and search engines deem valuable?</li>
      <li>What features or functionality does my website lack that other firms include on their site? This could be online scheduling, intake forms, eSignatures, online marketing integrations, or payment processing.</li>
    </ul>
- question: How does the B12 website design process compare to working with a design company or freelancer?
  answer: >-
    <p>When you hire a design company for your law firm website, it can cost up to $50K to achieve the final product. ​​The project’s timeline, scope, hours of your time, and the amount of feedback you’re required to give are significantly more than what you experience with B12.</p>

    <p>Say you want to make updates to your website over time. With an agency, you’re completely reliant on them to see changes made, which may take weeks or even months. They also have very limited tech support or customer success to help you with any website glitches or issues. With a design agency or freelancer, you won't gain access to features that support your firm's marketing strategy, forcing you to seek out third-party products on your own and pay separately for them.</p>

    <p>B12 approaches law firm web design a little differently than traditional agencies and freelance designers. We combine the power of experts and technology in an all-in-one platform that delivers the best experience for law firms and their clients. We design websites using modern principles that meet legal industry standards and help you stand out from other law firms.</p>
