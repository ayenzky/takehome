- question: What type of content should I include on my website?
  answer: >-
    <p>This depends on a few factors, including what your audience is searching for online, the services you offer, and timely topics that interest educators, students, and district leaders. Perform some keyword research related to your offerings to see what has traction, then try to create content that naturally includes that keyword.</p>
    <p>Beyond subject matter, the format of your content matters too. Are your visitors more likely to engage with a blog post, whitepaper, infographic, or video? On average, companies that blog get 55% more website visitors than firms that don’t.</p>
    <p>Some education topics you may want to create content for include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improving early childhood educational opportunities</li>
      <li>Increasing student engagement in schools</li>
      <li>How educational institutions can seamlessly adopt new technology</li>
      <li>Protecting teachers' well-being</li>
      <li>Teaching tips from former educators</li>
      <li>How can colleges remove bias from the application process</li>
      <li>Improving education and investments in under-funded schools</li>
      <li>How communities and schools can take a collaborative approach to student success</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Google favors websites that are topic experts on the subject matter they're writing about, so whatever topic you’re writing about, discuss it through the lens of your expertise.</p>
    <p>Once you have a process for regularly creating content, whether you do it yourself or outsource it to a third-party expert, keep track of how it’s performing. Take a look at your weekly organic traffic and any fluctuations in keyword position for the terms you’re trying to rank for, so you know what’s working and if you’re successfully increasing your traffic.</p>

    <p>As you look through examples of consulting firm websites, consider the individual elements (e.g., color palette or visual hierarchy) you want to emulate and why. For instance, if you're drawn to the font they're using, think critically about its weight, letter spacing, and if it's serif vs. sans serif. If you're not sure what you like about it, you'll want to spend some time playing around with fonts for your site until you find a similar one, or you can ask a web design expert to help you identify the exact or nearly identical font.</p>
