- question: Which digital marketing tools should my insurance business use?
  answer: >-
    <p>The right tools for your firm depend on your goals, but generally, these are impactful for insurance companies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Google Analytics for learning more about your traffic and website performance allows you to create a better SEO and marketing strategy</li>
      <li>A live chat tool like Drift to connect with visitors and gain insights into what they're looking for</li>
      <li>A contact manager like the one built into B21 websites to store lead information, client activity, and manage your entire pipeline to sell more insurance policies</li>
    </ul>
- question: How do I attract clients for each specific insurance type I offer?
  answer: >-
    <p>Create content that’s specific to your expertise and every insurance product you sell. Life insurance comes with a lot of terms that are unfamiliar to most people. Offer visitors some free resources that help them understand the ins and outs of life insurance, including beneficiaries, extended term insurance, premiums, or universal life insurance.</p>
- question: How can I get new customers to sign contracts sooner?
  answer: >-
    <p>Offering eSignatures rather than requiring in-person signatures will speed up your contract signing process and earn goodwill with clients, who appreciate a convenient online experience.</p>
- question: How do I outperform my competitors in the life insurance market?
  answer: >-
    <p>Two main ways: SEO and a better client experience. By doing keyword research and finding natural ways to rank higher on search engines, you'll get found by more potential customers and increase your website traffic. A great website with lead magnet capabilities will capitalize on your traffic, and creating a client-focused experience through tools like online payments, eSignatures, and online scheduling will help you sell more life insurance policies and retain clients.</p>

- question: What's the best layout for a life insurance agent’s website?
