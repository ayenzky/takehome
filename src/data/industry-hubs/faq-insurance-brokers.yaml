- question: How should insurance brokers approach web design?
  answer: >-
    <p>94% of first impressions relate to your website design, so if your site is poorly designed, you may lose visitors forever.</p>
    <p>Still, don’t overthink your web design. A simple, sleek layout with readable fonts, a cohesive color scheme, and appealing images are the key ingredients to making a favorable first impression with visitors. Your website design should not distract from your content, instead, it should underscore important calls to action and support conversion next steps.</p>
    <p>For insurance brokers especially, potential clients want to find as much information as possible online, so your site should make it easy to compare policies, see applicable discounts, request a quote, schedule a consultation, and make a purchase without leaving your site and without complication. Make sure your web design layout adds simplicity to each of these goals and processes, rather than overshadow it.</p>
    <p>Some additional insurance website design and user experience best practices include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure your website is mobile responsive and pages load in less than 2 seconds — the Google recommended page load time. Since half of today's website traffic comes through a mobile device, this is incredibly important.</li>
      <li>Place calls to action strategically to support your sales funnel (e.g., place an intro offer on a specific Service page or Contact page).</li>
      <li>Simplify your navigation with a clearly labeled menu with items intuitively ordered.</li>
      <li>Test out each page to ensure that visitors can find what they’re looking for in only a couple of clicks. If not, you’ll need to simplify your user experience and give them an effortless route to learn more about your services, find a resource, set up a consultation, or submit a contact form.</li>
    </ul>
- question: How do I write better insurance agency web copy?
  answer: >-
    <p>Focus on offering your visitors value. Insurance broker website copy should address the benefits and challenges that are top of mind to prospective clients. You need to communicate the complexities of insurance in simple terms and strike a balance between selling your services and making prospects feel comfortable as they make important decisions about their health, family, property, or business.</p>
- question: How can my insurance firm build a smooth client intake process?
  answer: >-
    <p>Strategic online workflows that include calls to action, forms, scheduling, and payments can reduce the steps to contact your insurance agency, work with you, and pay for your services. The simpler it is to work with you, the more likely someone will convert and remain loyal to your agency. Including client tools in your website has a huge impact on client acquisition and retention.</p>
    <p>For intake forms specifically, include as few fields as possible that will still allow you to understand a new client’s needs and provide them with tailored service. You can always ask them more questions during their first consultation or appointment. Your form should be short and straightforward to fill in. Don't ask for information you don't need, and remember that you can always tweak form fields later.</p>
