- question: Can I offer legal help on my blog?
  answer: >-
    <p>Yes, your blog is a great space to provide guidance on the immigration process, including articles about immigration status, visas, deportation, asylum, naturalization, and anything else your practice area handles that your audience might be Googling. One place to look for content ideas is the USCIS (U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services) or American Bar Association websites.</p>
- question: How can I market my immigration law firm online?
  answer: >-
    <p>A great way to gain traction online and get more eyes on your website is to be listed on relevant legal directories, including the American Immigration Lawyers Association website.</p>
- question: What kind of forms should I include on my immigration attorney website?
  answer: >-
    <p>The most effective forms you can add to engage visitors and clients are contact forms or “request a consultation” form that includes the option to schedule an appointment without delay. Both of these forms help you collect lead information and establish relationships with potential clients.</p>
- question: Are B12 websites search engine (SEO) optimized?
  answer: >-
    <p>Yes, during the launch process, your copywriters and SEO specialists will ensure your website content is optimized for the keywords and terms that your audience is searching for. For example, if your immigration law firm is located in Tallahassee, we’ll optimize it, so you’re more likely to appear in Google searches such as “immigration lawyer in tallahassee fl.”</p>
- question: Should my law firm site include a Process page?
  answer: >-
    <p>This is a great idea, especially since every firm operates in a unique way. Leads will appreciate it if you make it clear exactly what the process looks like when they work with you on various immigration cases, such as requesting asylum, trying to return to the U.S. after being deported, facing deportation proceedings, or green card eligibility. </p>
    <p>For each of these common circumstances, clearly explain your process and put visitors at ease. You can also include downloadable resources on these pages that provide even more detail about important processes.</p>
