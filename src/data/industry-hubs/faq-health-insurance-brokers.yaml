- question: What is a lead magnet landing page?
  answer: >-
    <p>A lead magnet is a marketing technique that attracts leads by offering a resource in exchange for the person’s contact information. Lead magnets usually take the form of an ebook, template, or another downloadable resource. </p>
    <p>For a health insurance company, an example of a lead magnet landing page is one where you advertise a free ebook on how to understand the features of a health insurance policy and choose the right one. Once visitors click a “download now” CTA button, your site presents a landing page where they fill out their name, email address, and any other relevant information. Then, they’ll receive your ebook in their inbox, and your firm will have gained a new lead.</p>
- question: What's the one CTA that drives the most clicks?
  answer: >-
    <p>The most effective CTA depends on the action you're encouraging. Whether you’re trying to nudge visitors to sign up for a discount offer, receive your agency's emails, or read about a new service you offer, make sure your CTA is clear. Best practices for all website calls to action are to keep them short and to the point. Use words that inspire action and resonate with your audience. </p>
