- question: How can I attract more traffic to my website?
  answer: >-
    <p>SEO (search engine optimization) is the most effective way to gain traffic that's more likely to work with you. If your brand strategy doesn't already include content marketing, you should consider adding a blog and writing posts yourself or hiring a creative writer to ghostwrite them for you.</p>
    <p>Frequent blog posts allow you to strengthen your search optimization for certain keywords, so your coaching business shows up closer to the top of Google results for that term. Anyone searching for terms similar to what you offer will be intrigued to then visit your site. Your blog gives them a place to gain business education, learn about your expertise, and be convinced of the value of hiring a coaching business.</p>

Securing more directory listings is a door opener to future opportunities by putting you at the forefront of where people are searching for a business coach, and can also help you identify your competitors.</p>
