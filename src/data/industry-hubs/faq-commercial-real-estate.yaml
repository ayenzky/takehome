- question: How much is a real estate agent website?
  answer: >-
    <p>The cost of building a website through DIY website builders can vary depending on the platform you choose and the features you need. The DIY route of website design could cost you as little as $20/month; however, you would miss out on having the guidance, support, and tools needed to truly look professional online. In contrast, paying a web design agency can cost tens of thousands of dollars and slow down the feedback and launch process, sometimes taking months to complete.</p>

- question: What is the fastest way to get commercial real estate clients?
  answer: >-
    <p>A CRE website can help your business generate leads and attract new clients. Your website can act as a lead-generating Swiss army knife: once visitors make it onto your site you can leverage valuable, downloadable content to collect lead information for your sales funnel. You can also employ enticing calls-to-action to encourage visitors to contact you for more information or to schedule a consultation. By capturing visitors' contact information, they can build a database of potential clients to nurture over time. And don’t forget about email marketing! Email marketing can help CRE firms stay top-of-mind with their contacts, build trust, and generate more business by nurturing leads, promoting listings, and encouraging referrals. There are also several online CRE directories that will increase your exposure to possible clients. For example, LoopNet features listings of commercial properties for sale and lease across the United States, including office spaces, industrial properties, retail spaces, and more.</p>
- question: What should a commercial realtor website look like?
  answer: >-
    <p>A commercial real estate website should look professional, be easy to navigate (especially on mobile devices), and be visually appealing. A CRE business website should be fully branded with a clear brand identity, that includes consistent use of the company logo, color scheme, and typography. Strong and consistent branding helps to establish trust and recognition with existing and potential clients. A commercial real estate website should use high-quality photos and videos to showcase properties and make them look as appealing as possible to potential buyers or tenants. A CRE website should have a clear and intuitive navigation menu to ensure site visitors find the information they need quickly.</p>
- question: What should I post on my real estate website?
  answer: >-
    <p>The content you post on your commercial real estate website should be informative, engaging, and valuable to your audience. By providing high-quality content, you can build trust with potential clients and establish yourself as a leader in the industry.</p>
    <p>Helpful information to engage site visitors and existing clients is key when planning out what to include on your CRE website. If you have been on any social media site lately, you’ll see that video content is everywhere and for a good reason: it’s highly engaging! Create virtual video tours of your properties to give potential tenants or buyers a more immersive experience. This can help them get a better sense of the space and visualize themselves in it, making it much easier to sell. This will also reduce the time your team spends showing properties to clients that do not satisfy their needs for a commercial space.</p>
    <p>Keeping a blog regularly updated is also a great strategy. Creating blog posts on various topics related to commercial real estate will keep your business in mind with existing clients and be seen as an industry thought leader for potential clients. This could include tips for property owners, market updates, industry news, case studies from successful clients, and new property listings. Blogging is a great way to establish yourself as an authority in your field and drive traffic to your website. Downloadable content hosted on your blog, such as a guide for first-time commercial real estate buyers or renters, is also a great way to show your expertise and bring in more leads to your sales funnel.</p>
- question: Do commercial real estate firms really need a website?
  answer: >-
    <p>Yes! A website is a valuable tool for any commercial real estate business looking to establish a strong online presence, generate leads, showcase their properties and expertise, and build credibility with potential clients.</p>
    <p>In today's digital age, having an online presence is essential for any business especially when competition is as high as it is in real estate. A CRE website provides a platform for your business to showcase your services, properties, and unique expertise. It allows potential clients to learn about your services, make informed decisions, and get to know the team they’ll work with when entrusting your firm with their business.</p>
    <p>Think of your business’s website as one of your most important marketing tools. Your CRE firm can use it to promote services and new listings, highlight your achievements and client success stories, and share relevant industry news and insights. Additionally, you can use search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to improve your website's visibility and attract more traffic.</p>
