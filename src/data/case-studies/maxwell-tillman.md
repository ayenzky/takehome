  description: >-
    Founded in 2015, Maxwell Tillman is a Birmingham law firm that focuses on
    personal injury, auto/truck accident, motorcycle accident, wrongful death,
    social security disability, and mass torts. The firm is passionate about
    advocating on behalf of individuals and groups that experience
    discrimination and other civil rights violations. 


    Maxwell Tillman started in founder Leroy Maxwell Jr.’s living room, where he worked tirelessly to build his firm and clientele base. In only a few months, he grew from 5 to 300+ clients and a team of 12 dedicated attorneys and staff fighting for justice across Alabama.

  customer: Maxwell Tillman
  problem: The firm’s website was a time-suck with limited features it had outgrown
challenge:
  title: The challenge
  description: Maxwell Tillman’s original website needed constant management, and
    by 2020, the firm’s content and visual needs had outgrown its online
    platform. Leroy received little guidance on how to improve the firm’s online
    efforts and knew he needed a cost-effective website service with a more
    hands-on approach. He wanted help growing his site while he focused on
    growing his business and began sourcing local alternatives with that
    priority in mind.

    During his search, Leroy tried local website designers based in Alabama but
    was unsatisfied with the results. Around this time, he discovered B12 and
    was impressed by the initial AI website draft. Receiving a prompt response
    from a B12 consultant, Leroy learned about B12’s website and SEO services,
    and was convinced to join. Maxell Tillman launched its 14-page B12 website
    in April 2020. 

    > “B12 did a wonderful job with my website. Convinced that together we could be effective, we signed on the dotted line in March 2020. In any industry, they tend to forget about you once you sign on the dotted line, but that was not the case with B12. Their continued support and monthly recommendations helped me grow my online presence significantly.”

  intro: >-
    Since launching a site with B12, Maxwell Tillman has seen incredible
    improvements in the way its website looks and performs. Mere weeks after
    launching, Leroy noticed an increase in the quantity and quality of the
    leads that Maxwell Tillman was generating. 


    > “In the past 4 months, our website traffic has increased by 40%, and our leads have increased by 7x. We’re growing each month exponentially thanks to the B12 team.”
  body: >-
    The Birmingham-based firm has also seen an increase in revenue since joining
    B12, and it ranks on the first page of Google for its main keywords. 


    With his website squared away and generating value for the firm, Leroy can focus on his dream. He wants Maxwell Tillman to grow and become known as Birmingham’s top personal injury law firm. He feels that B12 has positioned the company to make this a reality and encourages anyone considering B12 to give it a shot. 


    > “I would recommend B12 to any company that wants a team to manage and grow their website while they focus on growing the business. With B12, founders can rest assured that their website is in good hands and, more importantly, prove its value and ROI.”
