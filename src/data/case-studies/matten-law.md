    <p>Matten Law is an immigration law firm that uses automation and artificial
    intelligence to offer an elegant yet easy client experience. The firm
    provides legal support to people and companies worldwide, specializing in US
    work visas, startup advisory, and family immigration.</p>

    <p>After spending 20 years at large legal firms, founder Ron Matten pursued his dream of starting his own practice. He noticed that the legal industry continuously resisted adopting new technology into daily operations, and started Matten Law with the intention to embrace automation and other tech to make the immigration process more efficient for clients.</p>

  industry: Law
  customer: Matten Law
  problem: A tech-savvy firm with a low-tech website and small marketing budget
    needed to reach more leads
challenge:
  title: The challenge
  description: >-
    <p>
      Ron knows that connecting with his audience online is the key to his firm’s success. Unfortunately, Matten Law’s online presence didn’t do much to support that effort. Previously, the firm’s digital identity was merely a placeholder site with minimal functionality and support for its visitors and certainly didn’t reflect the company's mission as a modern, tech-savvy practice.</p>
    <p>
      As Ron searched for an alternative solution, he found several potential website development services, but none fit both his company’s values and budget. Matten Law was a lean team of three employees trying hard to grow, so Ron was conscious of every dollar spent and aware that every marketing decision had to be deliberate and scalable in the long run.
    </p> <p>
      As is the norm for any leader of a small company trying to scale, Ron’s daily tasks go beyond providing legal services to clients. His time is also spent networking, nurturing relationships, and finding new ways to market the firm. Referrals are a good start but not enough to propel Matten Law to its ambitious growth goals. To make those happen, Matten Law needed to attract more attention by showing up when people search for the legal services they offer.

  description: <p>Ron was looking for assistance with maintaining and developing
    the Matten Law site so he could refocus his time on running his business. As
    he sourced web design alternatives, he came across B12 on Facebook.</p>
    <p>“The concept of building an AI website really intrigued me. The use of AI
    aligned with my firm’s vision to use the latest technology. All I had to do
    was answer some questions and it generated a great-looking website draft. I
    was blown away.”</p> <p>He scheduled a demo with a B12 consultant. Impressed
    by the design quality of his AI draft and the other B12 features he learned
    on the call, he was surprised at its affordability compared to the
    alternatives, which hadn’t gotten him the results he wanted in the past.
    Instead of the static placeholer site he was stuck with, a new B12 site
    would be easy to update and evolve over time. With much more competitive
    pricing than the thousands that freelance designers charge, Ron was
    convinced to try B12 and never looked back.</p>

    <p>“We have added a partner and doubled the size of our team. More recently,
    [B12] redesigned our website to incorporate video into the homepage and was
    extremely helpful when we decided to refresh our brand. They made the
    process very easy to make updates while staying consistent with our prior
    branding. The site [now] helps better manage client leads by funneling to a
    single point of contact.”</p>

    <p>Ron continues to be impressed by B12’s ability to deliver the updates he wants and to do it so fast. Using B12, he launched the website he had tried for years to get from his previous website company in only two weeks.</p> <p>
      “With B12, it’s like they are part of my team. Unlike most website design companies and freelancers, B12 instilled strong confidence that they will always be there. They have held onto that promise for years and I have loved the entire experience.”
