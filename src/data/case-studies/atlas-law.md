    Jia Junaid saw a lack of female leadership in the legal industry and
    realized she was in the position to change that. To achieve her goal, Jia
    started Atlas Law in 2014, a private law firm specializing in practices in
    residential real estate, family, and immigration law.

    > “I wanted to start my law firm because I saw a void in female and minority representation in the legal community. Typically, private practices in corporate law and real estate are very male-dominated, and that is mirrored in my South-Asian ethnic community too. I wanted to break these boundaries and stereotypes and empower women to be leaders and have equal participation in these practices.”


    Committed to her cause, Jia grew and expanded her Canada-based company to represent clients from all over the world, including the United States, the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa.

  title: The challenge
  description: >-
    Embracing technology has been the cornerstone of Atlas Law’s success. While
    many large corporations lag in adopting technology, especially in the legal
    industry, Atlas Law is completely the opposite. 


    In launching a website, Jia knew that she wanted to digitize and modernize every aspect of her law firm, from legal documentation to expanding its online footprint. Despite a clear vision, Jia encountered difficulty when searching for the right platform to build her online presence. She tried several web design companies and freelance designers, which cost thousands of dollars and always returned underwhelming results.


    > “The website design industry is rife with scam artists, and you spend up to thousands of dollars to get nothing in return. I was jaded by the poor services in the market.”

    After some disappointing experiences with multiple website solutions, Jia
    found B12 on Facebook. In her words, “I was intrigued that a machine could
    create my website.” 


    It wasn’t a gimmick, though. Impressed by her initial AI draft, Jia scheduled a consultation with a B12 designer, who shared more about web design and personalization options for Atlas Law’s online presence. After the discussion, Atlas Law joined B12 in October 2018 and never looked back.

  title: The results
  intro: >-
    B12 has helped accelerate Atlas Law’s digital marketing strategy by
    identifying where its clients come from. Metrics tracking built into B12 has
    allowed Jia to narrow her efforts to the places that drive traffic.


    > “B12’s shows traffic coming to our website from a few different places, allowing me to focus my energy on certain directories that drive more traffic.”
  body: >-
    She also appreciates the constant support and guidance from B12. Atlas Law
    has continued to evolve and refine its online marketing strategy over time
    based on B12’s expert advice. Jia finds having professionals available to
    help with the site incredibly helpful, especially since the firm has no
    dedicated marketing staff to maintain and grow its online presence.


    > “I love that B12 prompts me to update certain features and add integrations like online scheduling to increase efficiency in my law firm. These recommendations are often things that I would have never considered but have proved to be incredibly useful.”


    With her business operating primarily online, she is able to effectively communicate with clients all over the world through her website. Thanks to B12, a strong team, and a globally connected network, the future looks bright for Atlas Law.
