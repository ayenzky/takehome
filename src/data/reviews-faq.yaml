- question: I already have a website, can I move it over to B12 and have you make some tweaks?
  answer: >-
    <p>If you have an old website, it’s often faster and easier to start from scratch than try to massage what you have. For that reason, we encourage each business owner to critically evaluate their site and send us the elements they absolutely wouldn’t want to lose – things like links to social media accounts, company description, business name, meta description, etc. We’ll make sure these pieces are worked into the design process and your new site.</p>
