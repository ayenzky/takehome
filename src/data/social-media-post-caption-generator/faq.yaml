- question: Why should I generate captions using an AI tool versus starting from scratch?
  answer: >-
    <p>Our AI writer allows you to save time creating unique captions. Starting from scratch is intimidating and often a slow process. With a social media generator, you can write great Instagram captions, engaging Facebook posts, and thought-provoking LinkedIn content more quickly than if you started from scratch. Generated ideas remove the burden of trying to create copy if you aren't a natural writer or you simply don't have time to write your own captions. Avoid a creative rut and spend more time running your business.</p>

Sometimes you have Instagram photos that you're excited to post, but you can't think of a good caption. An Instagram caption maker like B12's quickly provides a suggested caption based on your input.</p>
    <p>Next time you're facing a creative block, remember that you can get an engaging caption for your next Instagram post in just a few clicks.</p>
- question: How often should I publish new Instagram posts?
  answer: >-
    <p>It's generally recommended to post to your Instagram feed at least 2-3 times each week, and up to once per day. Start by establishing a regular cadence, even if that means you only post once per week. Over time, you'll figure out how often your audience wants to hear from you. Don't forget to post on Instagram Stories, too — <a href="https://blog.hootsuite.com/instagram-statistics/">500 million people</a> use Stories daily!</p>
    <p>If you don't have time to publish every day, you can pre-schedule posts in bulk using social media tools like Sprout Social, HubSpot, Buffer, or Hootsuite.</p>
- question: Will my Instagram posts get more likes if I use an Instagram caption generator?
  answer: >-
    <p>There's no quick fix to make your Instagram engagement explode, but there are proven techniques to improve yours without paying for likes and followers:</p>
    <p><ul>
    <li>Use the right hashtags</li>
    <li>Determine when your audience is online and schedule posts accordingly</li>
    <li>Make sure the visual aspect of your post is just as strong, if not stronger, than your caption. Instagram is a very visual platform, and you need to catch someone's eye with a well-composed image or video to convince them to read more.</li>
    <li>Sometimes the Instagram algorithm won't surface your posts to your followers' feed, so also share them on your Instagram Story for improved visibility</li>
    <li>Interact genuinely with other accounts</li>
    <li>Audit your competitors to discover what works well for them, then adjust your strategy</li>
    </ul></p>
- question: Is there a particular Instagram caption length I should stick to?
  answer: >-
    <p>While the Instagram captions interface allows for 2,200 characters, short captions tend to perform better. According to <a href="https://influencermarketinghub.com/best-length-for-social-media-posts/">Social Report</a>, your Instagram posts will perform best when limited to 138-150 characters. Since most people quickly scroll through Instagram, they’re unlikely to read the entire caption unless the post grabs their interest immediately. </p>
