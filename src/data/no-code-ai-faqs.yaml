- question: How much does No-code AI cost?
  answer: >-
    <p>B12 doesn’t charge a fee to use No-code AI, but OpenAI charges a fee based on your usage. OpenAI lets you start experimenting with $5 in free credits, which expire after 3 months. After using up your free credits, the amount you pay depends on how much you use your No-code AI form and how many words you exchange with the AI model each time you use it.</p>
    <p>Overall, usage fees are relatively inexpensive. A use-case that doesn’t involve much text, like “generate 5 subject lines for an email newsletter” would cost about $0.15 to use 1,000 times. A text-heavy use-case like “rewrite a 1,000-word case study to sound more professional” would cost about $0.05 to use once.</p>
- question: Is No-code AI secure?
  answer: >-
    <p>Because OpenAI can and will store your prompts for further training, you should be careful sharing sensitive information with your No-code AI form.</p>
- question: What are the benefits of using No-code AI?
  answer: >-
    <p>No-code AI lets you build custom AI tools for your business in under 60 seconds without writing any code. Bringing the brains of ChatGPT to your online presence, it offers a better way to attract and serve clients, scale your business, and save time on daily tasks. </p>

It adds efficiency, creativity, and accuracy to existing workflows, and helps you tackle new initiatives to grow your business.</p>
- question: When should I use No-code AI?
  answer: >-
    <p>No-code AI (like ChatGPT) is versatile, offering many ways to boost productivity and find quick answers. Whether you're doing competitor research to develop a new pricing strategy, brainstorming new calls to action, or trying to think of new ways to attract leads, No-code AI saves you time and surfaces the information you need.</p>

- question: How does No-code AI integrate with my B12 website?
  answer: >-
    <p>With No-code AI, ChatGPT is baked into your professional online presence. You can integrate the two by adding your own OpenAI API key. Once integrated, preview your website, fill out the form, and start generating text based on your prompt and the data you submit with the form.</p>
    <p>While No-code AI is highly efficient and helpful for internal use, you can also open it up to your website visitors, treating it as a lead magnet that instantly offers them value. Linking to your AI form URL in your website’s navigation makes it an interactive, public-facing tool.</p>
    <p>And, when using No-code AI for internal use cases, like drafting a new contract or outreach email, you can put your outputs to use without leaving B12. Copy and paste the AI-generated email copy or subject lines into <a href="https://www.b12.io/email-marketing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B12’s email marketing tool</a> and send emails directly from B12.</p>
- question: How can I responsibly use what AI creates for me?
  answer: >-
    <p>Since AI for generating text is a relatively new technology, you should only publish its output with editing and fact-checking, and you should understand the technology's limitations.
