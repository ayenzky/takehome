        A simple onboarding process gets you up and running in minutes. B12 has partnered with [Stripe](https://stripe.com) to bring you proven invoicing software for a convenient and secure online business workflow. We’ll collect a few details from you to quickly complete verification.


        Connect any US-based bank account to B12 Payments and Invoicing so that when you receive payments, you issue a payout and the funds are sent to your account.

        Once you’ve customized an invoice, it only takes a few clicks to email it to your client, requesting their payment. Hit send, then your client promptly receives an email from your business containing a secure landing page link, where they can pay online via credit card or ACH.<br>


        Payments and Invoicing safely processes your client’s information and for their protection, we never store payment details. Once a client submits a payment, you’ll both receive a confirmation email for your records.
