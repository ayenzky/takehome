    The growing firm needed an affordable website that didn’t compromise its
    forward-thinking vision
  description: >-
    <p>Driven by her passion to have a meaningful impact on society, Julliana
    Reyes, founder of Bailey Reyes, had a long-term goal to open her own law
    firm and help people in need. She quit her well-paying job at a tech company
    and started Bailey Reyes in 2018 with her longtime partner, Christopher
    Bailey, also an attorney.</p>


    <p>Bailey Reyes is a family and personal injury law firm based in Beaumont,
    Texas. Bold and passionate but always thoughtful, they aim to deliver
    exceptional legal services and build strong, lasting client
    relationships.</p>


    <p>Julliana and Christopher set out to build a virtual law firm that uses
    state-of-the-art technology, and they needed a high-quality website to
    portray their vision accurately. However, existing solutions were simply too
    expensive for the young company.</p>

  description: >-
    <p>Bailey Reyes faced the common struggle to balance costs and quality of
    service when searching for a website design company. Companies that
    specialize in law firm websites had extravagant fees, and the team was
    hesitant to hand over that much capital with no guarantee that the site
    would live up to their vision and philosophy.</p>


    <blockquote>"We tried law firm-specific web design services. However, our
    initial budget restraints prevented us from going forward with them. But we
    also did not want to create a BS website. </blockquote>


    <p>We want our website to look good and reflect who we are. At our firm,
    it's all about quality. We may not be big and have a lot of staff, but we
    want to emphasize the personal touch of our services, and we want to convey
    this on our website."</p>


    <p>Refusing to compromise on quality, Julliana Reyes continued searching for
    a new, more cost-effective web design solution when she discovered B12.</p>


    <blockquote>"I still remember that night when I tried B12's AI website
    draft. I was up late, Googling companies to help create my website. That’s
    when I stumbled upon B12 and created my first AI draft. I was blown away by
    the design and immediately screamed for Chris in the other room. He saw the
    draft and said ‘this is so good, how did you do that?!’" </blockquote>


    <p>Julliana and Chris felt that B12 was simply the best option to move the
    company into the future. The exemplary customer support during the free
    consultation solidified their choice to grow their business with B12. By the
    end of the call, Bailey Reyes was a B12 customer.</p>

    <p>Julliana and Christopher set up their website using the B12 Editor, and
    also collaborated with B12 designers. Within a week, the Bailey Reyes
    website officially launched.</p>


    <blockquote>"It was well within our budget. We get a lot of compliments on
    our website. Many potential clients are very impressed by our site, and
    often say it looks expensive. That's what we want to show people; we are all
    about quality."</blockquote>


    <p>Bailey Reyes' priority was to create a front-facing website for its
    clients to read the latest content and understand its mission before
    scheduling virtual consultations.</p>


    <p>Julliana knew that during Covid, she had to use the website to inform
    clients about any updates. Using the B12 Editor, she made immediate changes
    to her site to convey key Covid-related messages. </p>


    <blockquote>"What I really like about B12 is their website editor. It gives
    me the immediate capability to make the changes that I need to inform my
    clients quickly. The entire process of editing is easy and intuitive without
    needing any coding knowledge.</blockquote>


    <p>Being able to contact someone from the B12 team is also a huge plus as
    they very quickly respond to any question I have about my website. I created
    a Covid announcement banner for my website with the B12 team in just one
    meeting".</p> 


    <p>Bailey Reyes understands that virtual law firms need to be tech-savvy.
    The firm embraces technology across all processes, using solutions like B12,
    Clio, QuickBooks, and LawPay. As a result, the firm is entirely online,
    paperless, and cloud-based.</p>


    <p>With minimal overhead costs and zero physical constraints, unlike
    traditional law firms, Bailey Reyes had an agile and flexible business model
    proven to be highly successful during the recent pandemic and lockdowns.</p>


    <blockquote>"Technology is at the center of our ability to operate with
    minimal expenses without compromising on quality. B12 helped us maximize our
    capacity to serve our clients better and to increase our efficiency. B12 is
    truly the Apple of websites."</blockquote>
